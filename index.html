      <h1>Seniors Over 65 Are Due Big Rebate!</h1>
      
      <p><img class='homepic_1' src="images/224.jpg" alt=""></p>
      
      <div class="left_content">
      <p>There is a new rule that most seniors over 65 don't know about. If more people took advantage of this rule, the social administration would pay out millions of dollars in rightful rebates and evaluations.<br /><br />
      <p class="break cancel"><strong>Here is the new rule by the current administration:</strong></p>
      <p class="break cancel"><strong>If You:</strong></p>
      
      
			<blockquote>
        <li>Are Over The Age Of 65</li>
				<li>Live In A Qualified Zip Code</li>
			</blockquote>
			
      <p>Then you may qualify for one of the <strong>highest social  medicare rebates</strong> the nation has seen in the last 12 years. If you have not made a claim in the last 3 years, you may get an even larger rebate due to the new medicare rule that has been passed.</p>
      <h3><strong>Has Your Local Liaison Officer Bothered To Tell You About This?</strong></h3>
      <p>Jennifer wasn't aware of this new rule.</p>
      <p>She needed to <strong>save some money </strong> on bills after her and her husband retired from the post office. Her old boss was always great with the latest updates on medicare so she reached out for advice.</p>
      <br />
			<p>He looked over her bills and saw <strong>she was paying triple</strong> what he paid for his medicare bills despite the fact that her pension income was much smaller than his. He told her she needed to fix this ASAP.</p> 
			<br />
      <p>Her husband Steve usually handled all the bills but he had the flu and was in no shape to call anyone. So Jennifer was forced to do her own research.</p>
			<br />
      
      <p>Jennifer entered her zip code at <a href="https://www.cubn.club/"><strong><u>Medicare Rebates</u></strong></a> and was amazed at the total amount she was entitled to.</p>
      <br />
      <p><strong>"I Received a 4 Figure Rebate Due To The New Rule. I Only Wish I Found Out About This Rule Sooner."</strong><p>
      <p><strong>– Jennifer </strong></p>
			<br />
      <p>When Seniors go to <a href="https://www.cubn.club/"><strong><u>trusted sites</u></strong></a> they get an unbiased view of the new social  medicare programs in their area that <strong>INCLUDE</strong> any and all new rules implemented by the administration. Current data shows you could claim an additional four figures or more a year on medicare rebates.</p>
      <br />
			
      <p>Here is the lesson to learn – ALWAYS contact your local liaison officer to ensure that that you are well informed on the updated social medicare rules.</p>
